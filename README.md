# About

This GitLab repository contains source code for the front-end and back-end of the Evidence-based App (EBApp). The objective of the EBApp is to display scientific texts to users. The texts are all related to dentistry topics.

The development team is comprised of both undergraduate and graduate students from the University of SÃ£o Paulo. The code for this mobile application is available as open source. The application was developed using the Ionic Framework, specifically version 4.1.1.

At the time of writing, the Ionic Platform Documentation v4 beta can be accessed through the following link:
> https://beta.ionicframework.com/docs

## Pre-requisites
